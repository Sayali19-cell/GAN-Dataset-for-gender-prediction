vocab_size: The size of the vocabulary (number of unique tokens).
embedding_dim: The size of the word embeddings (dimensionality of word representations).
hidden_dim: The size of the hidden layer in the LSTM (or other recurrent neural network) used by the generator and discriminator.
label_dim: The size of the gender label (binary classification, so set it to 1).
seq_length: The length of each generated text sequence (number of tokens/words).
